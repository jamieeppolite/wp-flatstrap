WORDPRESS FLATSTRAP
===================

Twitter's bootstrap converted to a flat-design version.
This is still in the early stages and there is nothing to see yet, basic bootstrap is implemented and nothing more than that.

FEATURES
________

We’ve built the WordPress Flatstrap theme so that it could be used as-is or as a starting point for theme developers.
It’s built on top of the Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado and based on v2.1.1 of Twitter’s Bootstrap.

Keep up with this project's progress by starring it on Github.
